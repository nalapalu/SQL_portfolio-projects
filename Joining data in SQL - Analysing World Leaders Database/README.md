### 📊 Joining data in SQL - Analysing World Leaders Database

#### 📁 Dataset
> This project uses the world leaders database from Datacamp

#### 🎯 Objective
- Query using table joins and relational set theory in this course on joining data
- Use inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins, leverage set theory, including unions, intersect, and except clauses, and create nested queries
- Analyze data using SQL code

#### 🧠 Key Skills Applied
- `INNER JOIN` , or just `JOIN`
- Outer join `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`
- Set operations `UNION`, `UNION ALL` `INTERSECT` `EXCEPT`

#### 🧾 File Descriptions

#### 💭 Future Ideas / Improvements
- Use window functions to analyze monthly trends  
- Build a dashboard in Power BI  
- Compare year-over-year changes if time-series data is available
