## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts and related files for portfolio projects I’ve completed. The projects span across different industries and use cases, showcasing:
- Complex SQL queries.
- Database creation and management.
- Data cleaning and transformation.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. [**Data Manipulation in SQL - Analysing European Soccer Database** ](https://github.com/nalapalu/SQL_portfolio-projects/tree/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20SQL%20-%20Analysing%20Football%20database))
 
   *Objectives*:
   - Manipulate, transform, and make the most sense of your data
   - Wrangle, filter, and categorize information in a relational database,
   - Expand your SQL toolkit, and answer complex question
   - Use CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions
   - 
   *Skills*: CASE statements, Simple subqueries, Nested and correlated subqueries, Common table expressions, Window functions

2. [**Joining data in SQL - Analysing World Leaders Database**](https://github.com/nalapalu/SQL_portfolio-projects/tree/main/Joining%20data%20in%20SQL%20-%20Analysing%20World%20Leaders%20Database)
   *Objectives*: 
   - Query using table joins and relational set theory in this course on joining data
   - Use inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins, leverage set theory, including unions, intersect, and except clauses, and create nested queries
   
   *Skills*: `INNER JOIN` , or just `JOIN`, Outer join `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, Set operations `UNION`, `UNION ALL` `INTERSECT` `EXCEPT`

3. [**PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions - Summer Olyumpics dataset**](https://github.com/nalapalu/SQL_portfolio-projects/tree/main/PostgreSQL%20Summary%20Stats%20and%20Window%20Functions%20-%20Summer%20Olyumpics%20dataset)
   *Objectives*:
   - Generating rankings, calculating moving averages and running totals, deduplicating data, or performing time intelligence
   - Create queries for analytics and data engineering with window functions
   - Expand your SQL toolkit, and answer complex question
   - CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions
     
   *Skills*: - Window Functions: `ROW_NUMBER`,`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `LAG`, `LEAD`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, `NTILE`, Table Manipulation/Restructuring: `CROSSTAB` ,`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS`,`UNION ALL`, `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, String Manipulation: `STRING_AGG`

4. [**Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL - Sakila Schema**](https://github.com/nalapalu/SQL_portfolio-projects/tree/main/Functions%20for%20Manipulating%20Data%20in%20PostgreSQL%20-Sakila%20Schema)  
   *Objectives*:
   - use built-in PostgreSQL functions in your SQL queries
   - manipulate different types of data including strings, character, numeric and date/time
   - Use robust full-text search capabilities which provides a powerful tool for indexing and matching keywords in a PostgreSQL document.

   *Skills*: - Common data types in PostgreSQL, Date/time functions and operators, Parsing and manipulating text, PostgreSQL Extensions and full-text search
   
5. [**Analyzing Students' Mental Health**](https://github.com/nalapalu/SQL_portfolio-projects/tree/main/Analyzing%20Students'%20Mental%20Health)   
   *Objectives*:
   - Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health?
   - Explored the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.
   - 
   *Skills*: Data mani

3. ** PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions - Summer Olyumpics dataset**  
   *Objectives*: B 
   *Skills*: (e.g., Data Normalization, Performance Optimization)
